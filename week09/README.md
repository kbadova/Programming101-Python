# Cinema Reservation System

An implementation of a cinema reservation system.
We have movies, projections for that movie and reservations we can make for a given projection.

There are several commands we can use:

* `show_movies` - prints all movies ordered by rating.
* `show_movie_projections <movie_id> [<date>]` - prints all projections of a given movie for the given date (date is optional).
* `make_reservation` - makes a reservation, as the user chooses a name and number of tickets and the 						exact location ot the spots in the cinema hall
* `finalize` - finalizes the reswrvation 
* `cancel_reservation <name>` - disintegrate given person's reservation 
* `help` - show a list of learned spells
