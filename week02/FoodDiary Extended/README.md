# Food Diary - Extended

## Database with calories

In a file, called `calories.json`, we have calories per 100g for given foods.


## Keeping information about calories

When we add a food into our diary, we say how much we have eaten (in `g`).
Using the `calories.json` we calculate how much calories have we taken for that food.


### If we eat something that is not in the calories database,the program asks us for the calories of that food for 100g and saves that information in database.
